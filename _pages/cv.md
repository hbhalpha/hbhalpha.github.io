  # Projects
  ## MLLM as a Universal Image Retriever
  - We introduce an automated pipeline designed to create detailed multimodal composition datasets and present a large-scale dataset, FiGMaQ, to advance research in fine-grained context learning with MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models).
  - We propose a two-phase fine-tuning strategy that enhances the MLLM's capabilities in complex context understanding and query-target alignment, improving its performance across a wide range of image retrieval tasks. With distinct fine-tuning goals, this method also reduces the computational load.
  - We performed comprehensive evaluations on seven diverse image retrieval datasets, demonstrating the exceptional performance of our approach. Our method achieved state-of-the-art results across several challenging image retrieval tasks in a zero-shot, single-checkpoint setting, even when using a more compact MLLM architecture.
  ## Pseudo Triplet Guided Few-shot Composed Image Retrieval
  **Tools:** JavaScript, Python, MySQL  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/hbhalpha/PTG-FSCIR)
  - Proposed a two-stage pseudo triplet guided few-shot CIR scheme. The scheme incorporates a pseudo-triplet-based CIR pretraining stage with an attentive masking and captioning-based pseudo triplet generation method.
  - Introduced a pseudo modification text-based sample challenging score estimation method and a top range-based random sampling strategy.  
  - First to highlight the quality of selected training triplets, maximizing the benefit of few annotated triplets.
  - Plug-and-play and compatible with various CIR models, achieving improvements of up to 22.2% across datasets.

  ## Explainable Go AI
  **Tools:** Python, JavaScript  
  [GitHub](#)
  - Used MLLM and KataGo to align Go AI features with MLLM for game commentary generation.
  - The project is currently applying for national funding for further research.
